# Auto-Fix Suggestion

    **Category:** TERRAFORM_SYNTAX_ERROR
    **Confidence:** 95%

    ## Root Cause Analysis

    CATEGORY: Syntax Error  
CONFIDENCE: 0.98  
EXPLANATION: Terraform `validate` failed while parsing `main.tf` due to malformed string interpolation in the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. On line 25, the `name` attribute is defined as:  
`name = "rg-${var.prefix-${var.environment}"`  
This is invalid HCL because the interpolation braces are unbalanced and the expression is malformed (missing a closing `}` for `${var.prefix}` and the hyphen is placed inside the interpolation incorrectly). Once Terraform’s parser gets out of sync from the unclosed interpolation/string, it reports “Invalid multi-line string” on subsequent lines (26 and 27) even though `location = "eastus"` and the closing `}` are not the real problem—they are just where the parser notices the file is still in a broken string/expression context.  

CAN_AUTOFIX: False  
SUGGESTED_FIX:  
1. Fix the `name` string interpolation on `main.tf` line 25 so both variables are interpolated correctly and all braces are closed. For example:  
   - If you want `rg-<prefix>-<environment>`:  
     ```hcl
     name = "rg-${var.prefix}-${var.environment}"
     ```  
   - Or using `format()` (often clearer/safer):  
     ```hcl
     name = format("rg-%s-%s", var.prefix, var.environment)
     ```  
2. Re-run `terraform fmt` to normalize formatting and help catch similar issues.  
3. Re-run `terraform validate` to confirm parsing succeeds before proceeding to plan/apply.
