# Auto-Fix Suggestion

**Category:** TERRAFORM_MISSING_VARIABLE
**Confidence:** 95%

## Root Cause Analysis

CATEGORY: Syntax Error  
CONFIDENCE: 1.0  
EXPLANATION: The Terraform configuration contains a syntax error in the interpolation of variables within the `azurerm_resource_group` resource's `name` attribute. The error is due to a missing closing brace in the interpolation expression: `name = "rg-${var.prefix-${var.environment}"`. This results in an invalid Terraform configuration that fails validation.  
CAN_AUTOFIX: False  
SUGGESTED_FIX: Correct the syntax error in the `main.tf` file by ensuring that all braces are properly closed in the interpolation expression. The corrected line should be: `name = "rg-${var.prefix}-${var.environment}"`. This change ensures that the variable interpolation is correctly formatted and will allow the Terraform validate step to succeed.
