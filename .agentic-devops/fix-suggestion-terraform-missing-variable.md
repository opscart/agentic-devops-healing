# Auto-Fix Suggestion

                **Category:** TERRAFORM_MISSING_VARIABLE
                **Confidence:** 95%

                ## Root Cause Analysis

                CATEGORY: Configuration Error
CONFIDENCE: 1.0
EXPLANATION: The Terraform configuration is missing the definition of the `azure_region` variable, which is referenced in the `main.tf` file. This causes a failure during the Terraform plan phase because Terraform cannot resolve the `var.azure_region` variable.
CAN_AUTOFIX: True
SUGGESTED_FIX: Add the missing `azure_region` variable definition to the `variables.tf` file. For example:

```hcl
variable "azure_region" {
  description = "Azure region for resource deployment"
  type        = string
  default     = "eastus"  # or any preferred default region
}
```

This will ensure that the `azure_region` variable is defined and can be used in the `main.tf` configuration.
