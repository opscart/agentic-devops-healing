# Auto-Fix Suggestion

**Category:** TERRAFORM_MISSING_VARIABLE
**Confidence:** 90%

## Root Cause Analysis

CATEGORY: Configuration Error  
CONFIDENCE: 0.9  
EXPLANATION: The Terraform configuration specifies an incorrect region format for the Azure Resource Manager (azurerm) provider. The location for the `azurerm_resource_group` resource is set to "east-us", which is not a valid Azure region format. The correct format should be "eastus". This incorrect region format will cause the Terraform plan to fail as it cannot recognize the specified location.  
CAN_AUTOFIX: True  
SUGGESTED_FIX: Update the `location` attribute of the `azurerm_resource_group` resource in the `main.tf` file from "east-us" to "eastus". This change will correct the region format and allow the Terraform plan to execute successfully.
