# Auto-Fix Suggestion

**Category:** TERRAFORM_MISSING_VARIABLE
**Confidence:** 95%

## Root Cause Analysis

CATEGORY: Configuration Error  
CONFIDENCE: 1.0  
EXPLANATION: The Terraform configuration is missing the definition for the variable `azure_region`, which is referenced in the `azurerm_resource_group` resource. This results in a failure because Terraform cannot resolve the variable `var.azure_region` during the plan phase.  
CAN_AUTOFIX: True  
SUGGESTED_FIX: Add the missing `azure_region` variable definition to `variables.tf`. Here is an example of how to define it:

```hcl
variable "azure_region" {
  description = "The Azure region where resources will be created"
  type        = string
  default     = "eastus"  # or any valid Azure region
}
```

This change will resolve the missing variable reference and allow the Terraform plan to proceed successfully.
