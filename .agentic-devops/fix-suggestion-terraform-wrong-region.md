# Auto-Fix Suggestion

    **Category:** TERRAFORM_WRONG_REGION
    **Confidence:** 95%

    ## Root Cause Analysis

    CATEGORY: Configuration Error  
CONFIDENCE: 0.99  
EXPLANATION: Terraform init and validate succeeded, but `terraform plan` failed when creating the Azure Resource Group `azurerm_resource_group.test`. The `location` value is set to `"east-us"` (with a hyphen), which is not a valid Azure location name for the AzureRM provider. Azure locations must match the provider’s supported list exactly (e.g., `eastus`, `eastus2`, etc.). Because `"east-us"` is not in the supported locations list, the provider rejects the configuration and planning stops with exit code 1.  
CAN_AUTOFIX: True  
SUGGESTED_FIX: 1) Update the resource group location in `main.tf` to a supported Azure location string (no hyphen). For example:  
   - Change: `location = "east-us"`  
   - To: `location = "eastus"`  
2) If the location is parameterized, ensure the variable/default value uses a supported name (e.g., `eastus`) and not a display name with hyphens/spaces.  
3) Re-run `terraform plan` after the change to confirm the provider accepts the location.
