# Auto-Fix Suggestion

    **Category:** TERRAFORM_WRONG_REGION
    **Confidence:** 90%

    ## Root Cause Analysis

    CATEGORY: Syntax Error  
CONFIDENCE: 0.78  
EXPLANATION: The pipeline YAML content shown in the logs is corrupted by stray byte-string fragments (`b'...'`) inserted into the script and even into variable references. Specifically, the `cd` command is broken as `cd $(Bui'b'ld.SourcesDirectory)/...` and `terraform plan` is broken as `terraform pla'b'n`. These injected fragments will cause the inline bash script to fail (invalid variable name / command not found / path resolution failure), preventing Terraform from running. This is not a Terraform/provider issue; it’s a malformed pipeline definition or a logging/templating step that is emitting Python-bytes-literal artifacts into the actual YAML/script content.  
CAN_AUTOFIX: False  
SUGGESTED_FIX:  
1) Fix the pipeline YAML so the inline script contains only valid bash and valid Azure DevOps variables (no `b'...'` fragments). It must be:  
   - `cd $(Build.SourcesDirectory)/infrastructure/test-apps/infra-only/terraform/scenarios/wrong-region`  
   - `terraform plan`  
2) Identify and remove the source of the byte-literal injection:  
   - If the YAML is generated by a script (Python/templating), ensure you decode bytes to string before writing (e.g., `content.decode('utf-8')`) and do not print/serialize raw `bytes` objects.  
   - If using a template/transform step, verify it is not concatenating `bytes` representations into YAML fields.  
3) Re-run the pipeline after confirming the rendered YAML in Azure DevOps (the “View raw pipeline” / compiled YAML) shows correct strings without `b'...'`.
